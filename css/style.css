/* need to finish buidling everything for this portfolio. 
I started over this morning with a new portfolio page out of frustration in trying to change old css and 
html. I'm working on responsiveness with the flow in resizing the page. I need to continue working on the html
and layout. I need to add links and assets/images to the portfolio page. I need to finish up the boxes on my contact page.
Generally clean up the page and make it look like an actual web site.  */
